# Celestica
Celestica is a unique ASCII-based solar system simulator that brings celestial mechanics to life using text-based art. This project is designed to simulate the orbits of planets and stars within a stylized representation of the solar system.
# Technologies Used
Python: The core language for logic and rendering.
ASCII Art: Visualizing the solar system in text-based graphics.
Mathematics: For orbital calculations (elliptical paths, velocities).
# Brief project's execution description
So the heart of the project is the *__renderer.py__* file. It is responsible for rendering the solar system in ASCII.

*__physics.py__* is, well, responsible for the physics of the project ᕕ༼⌐■-■༽ᕗ
